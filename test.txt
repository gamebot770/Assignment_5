DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's  TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory on the wuarchive.  They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions, dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or dtax.exe.  I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing  away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very well written.   The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you figure out the tricks.  I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.  If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing  to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then  it would work...

I would greatly appreciate  information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are  easily accessible from the UNIX environment.   The names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any  experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful.  Please respond via email; I will post a summary if there is  sufficient interest.   Thanks, Ken   P.S.  I have found several impressive systems for IBM PC's, but I would  like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate PC if  at all possible.

Date: Mon, 05 Apr 93 14:58:21 MDT Lines: 11  I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines  called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor).  Could anyone tell me where I can  FTP the source code and which is the newest version around? Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman  is like SIPP?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make  a program that creates the image...

This color-resolution is   see some small machbanding on the smooth color-gradient picture, but all in all, There _ARE_ situiations where you get visible mach-banding even in a 24 bit card. If you create a very smooth color gradient of dark-green-white-yellow or something and turn up the contrast on the monitor, you will probably see some mach-banding.  While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here, he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.  Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities. The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on the brighter side and darker on the darker side.  Andre   Andre Yew andrey@cco.caltech.edu (131.215.139.2) </doc>

Especially interesting would be volumetric data from brain scans, electromicographs, and so forth.  Please email me and let me know if you know of such.    The HumBio Project is a CD-ROM-based curriculum tool for sixth-, seventh-, and eigth-graders, studying the function of the human brain and the effects of neurotransmitters, alcohol, and drugs.  The will be a special focus in depicting the effects of neurotransmitters on behavior. Volotta Interactive Video is producing this project for Stanford Univers ity. We are currently in a pre-production phase and we are looking for data sets and visualizations depicting brain function on the whole brain, neuron and molecular levels.  We intend to use state-of-the-art visualization tools to render instructive visualizations from two-, three-, and four-dimensional data sets as well as using already-completed visualizations to their best effect.  </doc>
